        <p>I am a Software Engineering student who does what he likes. My main objective by doing this course is to obtain enough knowledge to make a complete and commercial website. I'm studying machine learning combined with Full Stack because I want to be able to create applications and systems that are not only efficient and functional, but also intelligent and adaptable. The combination of these two areas will allow me to develop complete technological solutions, from data collection and management to the implementation of machine learning algorithms to improve user experience and optimize processes. I want to be at the forefront of technology, creating products that make a difference and improve people's lives.</p>
